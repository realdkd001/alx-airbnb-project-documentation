# User Stories – Airbnb Clone Backend

## Objective
This directory contains the core user stories derived from the use case diagram created in Task 1 of the ALX ProDev Backend Airbnb Clone project. These stories define the primary interactions between users and the system.

## Purpose
User stories help translate technical requirements into human-centered goals. They focus on what users need to do and why, guiding the design, development, and testing of features.

## File(s)
- `user-stories.md` – A markdown file containing user stories for key system features such as:
  - User registration
  - Property listing
  - Booking
  - Payment
  - Profile management
  - Admin functions

## Example Format
Each story follows the structure:

As a `[user role]`,
I want to `[perform an action]`,
so that `[I achieve a goal or benefit]`.
